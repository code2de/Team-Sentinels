# HackathonFakeReview
This project is a Fake Review Detection system built using machine learning techniques to classify product reviews as either "Fake" or "Positive". It uses a trained machine learning model to analyze text reviews and predict whether a given review is fake or genuine.
Features
Web Interface: Users can input product reviews through a web interface and get instant predictions on whether the review is fake or positive.
Machine Learning Model: The model uses NLP techniques and TF-IDF to analyze the text of the review and make predictions. The classification is done using a Logistic Regression model.
Real-Time Prediction: Once a review is submitted, the model returns the result (either fake or positive) immediately on the web page.
Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language for model development and backend of the application.
Flask: Lightweight web framework for creating the web interface.
Scikit-learn: Library for building and training the machine learning model.
TF-IDF: Text vectorization technique used to convert text data into numerical format.
HTML/CSS: Used for designing and styling the web page interface.
